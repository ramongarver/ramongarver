### 🧑🏽‍💻 Hi, I’m Ramón García Verjaga (@ramongarver) 

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** with over three years of experience, specializing in backend microservices and thriving in dynamic, collaborative environments. My journey includes working on [**one of the world's most widely used SaaS ticketing systems**](https://www.secutix.com/) 🎫⚽ for global events like the FIFA World Cup, and more recently, enhancing and evolving [**IKEA's second-hand product sales platform**](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/campaigns/second-chance-corner-online-pubebfe3f30) ♻️📦.

- 🔧 **Tech Stack:** Java, Python, TypeScript, Spring, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, GCP...
- 🎯 **What Drives Me:** I’m energized by working in companies that not only create amazing products but foster a culture of growth, collaboration, and innovation. Staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends, I’m proactive and always eager to learn something new.
- 🌍 **Beyond Code:** In addition to my passion for tech, I’ve been an amateur actor for over 20 years and love participating in theatre. I’m also a dedicated volunteer, helping international students adapt to new cultures, and enjoy teaching and inspiring others to learn.

The idea of working on challenging projects alongside ambitious, talented people excites me, especially when it means making a real impact on the final product. Let’s connect and build something amazing together! 🚀
